# Android Inventory App New Version


## Software Design and Engineering
## Describe the Artifact
The artifact I chose for the software design and engineering part is an Android inventory management app. It requires the user to create a login that allows them to access the inventory app. Once logged in the user has multiple categories in which they can store various inventory items. The app allows the user to create, edit, and delete categories and items once inside each category. I initially created it in my CS-360 course in October of 2022.
## Justify the Inclusion
The reason I chose this artifact to include in my ePortfolio is it demonstrates three skills, my ability to develop an Android app, proficiency in Java as well as object-oriented programming, and my ability to code using XML. Through these three key skills, I also can demonstrate my ability to handle both frontend and backend development. I made many improvements to my original design to improve not only the overall functionality but to improve the overall aesthetic as well. As for aesthetics, I changed the category grid layout to have a span of three columns instead of two to increase the overall real estate available to display categories on a single page without the need for the user to have to scroll through categories while still keeping the logic to allow for the user to scroll through them if needed. I changed the background to have a more minimalistic look and added the background to all of the app layouts instead of just some of them to keep a cohesive design and feel for the app. I made text labels bold to increase visibility and make it easier to read. I changed the color palette used for the cards used to display the categories to better match the colors used in the app. I made a small adjustment to the overall layout bringing it up toward the top of the screen so that it looked more centered toward the top than centered on the whole screen. I also changed the logo to a more professional-looking design instead of the previous design which had a clip art look to it. As for the functionality, I created a separate registration page that the user can only access once when first setting up the app to prevent unauthorized access to the app as was possible with the previous design. I added key listeners to both the LoginActivity and NewUserActivity to prevent the user from creating a new line in the EditText fields when the user presses enter on the keyboard. I added checks to the SaveButtonClick to prevent the user from adding items without filling in all of the text fields. I added toasts to present to the user after they decide rather or not to approve SMS permissions displaying to them their choice in case they are unsure or accidentally choose the wrong choice. I also cleaned up some of the code that needed improvements such as in the CategoryActivity file line 65, where I opted to simplify an if-else statement by instead negating the original if statement parameters so that I could move the logic from the else statement into the if statement and removed the else statement altogether. I also removed functions and imports that were unused relating to the toggle visibility function that is no longer needed and an unused action bar import and function in the ItemEditActivity.
## Reflect on the Process
The biggest challenge I faced initially was getting reacquainted with the many aspects of the app, all of the files, and how they interact but after spending a bit of time working with it and reviewing some documentation I was up to full speed and able to pick up momentum to enhance the app. The biggest takeaway I learned from creating and improving the Andriod app was the importance of regular practice using the skills I have learned in my software and engineering degree makes a huge difference in my ability to pick up not only where I left off on an older project but how this will be key in my future career endeavors as I will face code that I did not develop and will have to catch up to speed with code I have not worked on before.

## Navigating the App
When first opening the app for the first time the user will be asked to create a user login. For security, this will be the only time the user will be able to create a user login on their device (store your login somewhere safe!). From there the user will be taken to the login screen where they can log in. Once logged in there are already three default categories for inventory items to be stored in. For ease of management with large inventory databases there is an option menu in the top right-hand corner that allows the user to filter categories either alphabetically, or in ascending or descending order based on the time of the category's creation. Once inside one of the categories, the user can add, edit, delete, or cycle through inventory items.

## Course Outcomes Met Through the Enhancements of the Android Inventory Management App
In completing the coursework for my software and engineering enhancement I was able to develop and showcase the strengths I have built in the computer science program by meeting all five of the expected course outcomes. I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing enhancements such as making the app more user-friendly and visually appealing, by transforming the category grid layout to a three-column span from the original two and applying a minimalistic design philosophy to the app's background across all layouts. This ensured a coherent design language that is inclusive to a diverse audience. I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that were coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by optimizing user feedback mechanisms, and incorporating toasts to clarify user decisions regarding SMS permissions, ensuring they were aware of their choices. I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solved a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to their solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by incorporating key listeners into both the LoginActivity and NewUserActivity. This hinders the creation of a new line in EditText fields when users press enter, improving the user interface and preventing unwanted input demonstrating my ability to discuss experiences and best practices in designing and evaluating computing solutions. I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by simplifying an if-else statement in the CategoryActivity file and removing redundant functions and imports, which were no longer required, streamlining the code and enhancing its efficiency and demonstrating my ability to create industry-standard software design. I developed a security mindset that anticipated adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by designing a one-time access registration page. This significant enhancement mitigates potential unauthorized access, which was a vulnerability in the previous design, and greatly enhances the app's security features.

## Databases

## Describe the Artifact
The artifact I chose to demonstrate my skills in databases is the inventory app from my CS-360 course that I completed at the end of October 2022. It is an inventory management system designed as an Android app that manages three databases within the app, the user database, the category database, and the item database. It allows users to have a secure way to access and manage a database intuitively on a mobile device.
## Justify the Inclusion
I selected the Inventory Management Android app to showcase my skills in databases because it shows my ability to work with multiple SQL databases at once at both low-level CRUD operations to more complex aggregation functions. It also demonstrates my ability to work with dynamically changing data in a secure and manageable way. I made several changes to improve the code from both a functional and security standpoint. First I implemented unused code in the getCategories method switch by implementing an option for the user to call any of its cases in the CategoryActivity page of the app via a drop-down menu to sort the categories. I removed an unnecessary semicolon on line 19. I also closed the cursors after use in each method that used them. The most important of all the changes I made though was to encrypt the user passwords using the bcrypt library to hash the user password before storing it in the database instead of as plain text as was done previously. This meant I had to implement the hashing of the password in the addUser method and verify the user input in comparison to the hashed password in the grantUserLogin method using the bcrypt library.
## Reflect on the Process
Through the planned enhancements of the Inventory Management app, I learned many valuable skills in problem-solving, security, and working with pre-existing libraries. The most challenging aspect of the enhancement was implementing the bcrypt library as it had limited documentation and was difficult to figure out how to integrate with the artifact. From this though I learned a lot about adding pre-existing libraries from GitHub into a project that I am working on. I learned about the importance of password hashing and how even though a person might not be able to exploit a SQL injection on the database, storing sensitive data such as user passwords as plain text in a database is bad practice and risks exploitation from malicious actors. I learned to problem solve and the importance of thorough documentation as I was on the receiving end of poor documentation and had to do a lot of research that also was not an easy task as would have been either better documentation, clearer comments, or a step-by-step guide on how to use the library and many of the resources I found were only partially useful or did not fit the scenario in how I was trying to use it. I was able to work my way through it regardless and problem-solve the situation so that I was able to implement the solution despite these issues.
## Course Outcomes Met Through the Enhancements of the Android Inventory Management App
Through the multiple databases in the Android inventory management app, I meet multiple course outcomes for this assignment showcasing my strengths in the computer science field by demonstrating my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools by researching how to hash data that needs to be stored securely, finding a reliable solution in a prebuilt library, and implementing that library into my artifact. I developed a security mindset in doing this that anticipated adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs with the user database by exposing potential vulnerabilities in the fact that the user password was previously being stored as plain text in the database. I developed a solution to mitigate the design flaw and ensure privacy by hashing the user password before storing it in the database. Ensuring the privacy of the sensitive data stored in the database. I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by enhancing the in-code comments that improved the understandability of the code’s functions and allows for other industry professionals to come in and collaborate within the project when needed. The comments also allow stakeholders to easily review the code's functionality and make design changes and improvements that better meet their expectations before the deployment of the code. I demonstrated my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practice to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the enhancements to the storage and security of user passwords by hashing the password before storing them in the database which meets industry-standard software designs and best practices.
